# PWC Virtual Internship - Task 1: Call Data Survey Dashboard

## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard was created for Claire to visualize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to call center operations. The dashboard provides an intuitive interface for analyzing important metrics, enabling data-driven decision-making to improve overall performance and customer satisfaction.

## Key Features and KPIs
The dashboard includes several important KPIs and metrics to monitor the efficiency and quality of customer service:

- **Overall Customer Satisfaction**: Reflects the percentage of customer satisfaction based on post-call surveys, displayed in a gauge or bar chart for easy interpretation.

- **Overall Calls Answered/Abandoned**: Compares the number of calls successfully answered against those abandoned. Visualized using a pie or stacked bar chart to provide a quick overview of call handling efficiency.

- **Calls by Time**: A time-based visual (line chart or heatmap) that showcases the volume of calls received over time (e.g., by hour, day, or month), helping identify peak and low call periods.

- **Average Speed of Answer**: A line chart that tracks how quickly calls are answered on average, providing insights into operational efficiency and customer wait times during various periods.

- **Agent Performance Quadrant**: A scatter plot displaying each agent’s average handle time (talk duration) versus the number of calls they’ve answered. This quadrant analysis helps identify top-performing agents and those who may require additional training or support.

## Dataset
The dashboard uses data from a call center dataset, including:

- Call logs (answered, abandoned, time stamps)
- Customer satisfaction ratings from post-call surveys
- Agent performance data (talk time, number of calls handled)

## Dashboard Navigation
- **Interactive Filters**: The dashboard allows users to filter data by date, call status, and agent to focus on specific time periods or individuals.
  
- **Visuals**: The data is presented using different visualizations like pie charts, bar charts, line graphs, and scatter plots, making it easy for Claire to digest key insights and trends.

## Insights and Recommendations
1. **Customer Satisfaction Monitoring**: The dashboard provides real-time tracking of customer satisfaction, helping Claire to assess the impact of operational changes on customer experience.
  
2. **Operational Efficiency**: Metrics such as the average speed of answer and calls by time give insights into call center performance, enabling managers to adjust staffing or shift schedules to meet demand more effectively.

3. **Agent Performance**: The scatter plot quadrant analysis allows Claire to evaluate agent productivity, encouraging better performance through targeted training programs.

## Conclusion
This Power BI dashboard is a powerful tool for monitoring and improving call center performance. It provides clear, actionable insights into customer satisfaction, call response efficiency, and agent productivity. By leveraging these insights, Claire can make informed decisions to optimize operations and enhance customer service.

## How to Use the Dashboard
1. Open the Power BI file (`Call Data Survey Dashboard.pbix`).
2. Use the filters available to view specific time periods, agents, or call statuses.
3. Interact with the various charts and visuals to explore the KPIs and gain deeper insights into call center operations.
